NexaShe's Asha AI Chatbot
Asha is an AI-powered chatbot developed for the JobsForHer Foundation to empower women in their career journeys. Built with Streamlit, it provides job listings, career resources, event information, resume building, and personalized career guidance through an intuitive web interface. The chatbot integrates with the JobsForHer API (or uses sample data) and leverages a local Ollama model (Llama 3.2) for natural language processing.
Features

Interactive Chat: Engage with Asha via text or voice to get answers about job listings, events, career advice, and more.
Predefined Questions: Quickly access common queries like "Show me job listings" or "What are upcoming events?".
Resume Builder: Generate professional resumes in Markdown format based on user profiles or upload existing resumes for analysis.
User Profile Management: Store personal details, skills, education, and work history for tailored responses.
Multilingual Voice Support: Use speech-to-text for input and text-to-speech for output in languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, and more.
Contact Form: Submit inquiries to the JobsForHer team.
Bias Prevention: Detects and redirects biased queries to promote inclusivity.
API Integration: Fetches real-time job listings, events, and resources from the JobsForHer API (or uses sample data if API credentials are unavailable).
Response Caching: Enhances performance by caching API data and chatbot responses.
